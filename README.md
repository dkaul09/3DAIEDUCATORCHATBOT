# 3D AI Educator Chatbot: Enhancing Learning through Conversation

Welcome to the **3D AI Educator Chatbot** project! This chatbot is designed to help students, especially those in middle school and preschool, engage in more meaningful learning experiences. The goal is to reduce the over-reliance on AI for simple answer retrieval and, instead, foster real understanding and critical thinking.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The idea behind this project came from a common observation: students often use AI tools to get quick answers without fully understanding the problem-solving process. While it's convenient, it doesn’t do much for long-term learning. So, I set out to create a solution that encourages students to think more deeply.

This chatbot is built to simulate a more **Socratic learning method**, where it asks thoughtful questions and encourages students to explore problems on their own. The aim is to improve **problem-solving skills** and boost **critical thinking**, making the process of learning both interactive and engaging.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The chatbot is powered by a **JavaScript backend** that interfaces with the GPT API and LangChain. It’s designed to deliver a more dynamic conversation flow, complete with memory, so it can:

- Engage in contextually aware conversations, remembering prior interactions to ask meaningful follow-up questions.
- Help students clarify doubts and guide them toward the right solutions without simply giving away answers.
  
This is more than just an AI assistant; it's a conversational tool designed to mimic a real-life tutor, one that promotes learning rather than just completing homework.

## 🧑‍💻 Technology Stack

Here’s a quick overview of the technologies that make this chatbot tick:

- **JavaScript Backend**: Handles interaction logic and communication between the chatbot and the GPT API.
- **GPT API**: Provides natural language understanding and response generation.
- **LangChain**: Facilitates advanced conversational memory, allowing for better dialogue continuity.

## 📚 My Vision

When I started this project, my goal was to create something that contributes to **real learning**. I wanted to move away from the passive consumption of answers and create an AI that challenges students to think, reflect, and truly engage with the material. This chatbot is meant to be a **companion for learning**, encouraging students to solve problems step-by-step, just like a tutor would.

It’s especially designed for **younger learners**, using simplified language and encouraging feedback to keep them engaged while also helping them develop critical thinking skills. The 3D interface adds a visual element that makes the learning process even more immersive and fun.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **Yarn** installed on your system.

To get started and run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this Github repository.
2. Open 2 terminals: one in the front-end directory and the other in the back-end directory.
3. Run yarn dev in both the terminals to start the back end and then the front end. You should then get a link where you can interact with the 3D Chatbot.

## ⚠️ Current Bug 🐛

Currently, there is a known bug, where the avatar and the interface to chat with the avatar has disappeared. I'm actively working on fixing this issue and will update this repository as soon as the bug is resolved. Thanks for your patience!
